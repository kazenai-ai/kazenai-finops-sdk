By contributing, you agree that your contributions are licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, unless a separate agreement states otherwise.

## Development
Use Python 3.10+; CI verifies Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12. Prefer tests that do not require private sibling checkouts. Do not commit secrets, `.env` files, or private customer data.

Maintainers must follow [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md). A release must resolve its
declared Core dependency from public PyPI and must be built from the exact clean
commit that passed the full CI matrix.

## Code of conduct
Be respectful. No harassment or spam.
